Emotient Matlab SDK
===========

This [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com) library wraps the [Emotient Analytics API](https://analytics.emotient.com). The library share most of its functionality with [emotient-python](https://github.com/emotient/emotient-python).

This library is a module of [fex-metrica](fexmetrica.com), a toolbox developed to postprocess and analyze facial expression time series detected with system such as [Emotient Analytics](https://emotient.com).

Installation & Requirements
===========

Requirements
------------

The code was developped on OS X, and Ubuntu 12.04. Most functionality will work on Windows as well. However, some methods use Unix syntax. This code was tested on Matlab v2015a.

Installation from emotient-matlab repository
------------

To install this library, go to a terminal and issue the following command:

```
cd some/directory/
git clone https://github.com/filipporss/emotient-matlab.git
cd emotient-matlab && install.sh

```

In order to use the library, type the following on the Matlab command line:

```Matlab

fex_init;

```

Installation with [FexMetrica](fexmetrica.com)
------------

You can install emotient-matlab with [FexMetrica](fexmetrica.com), by following these [instructions](fexmetrica.com).


Object Description
===============

The main class used for interfacing with [Emotient Analytics API](https://analytics.emotient.com) is [emotient_api](emotient_api.m). The class can be constructed using the following code:

```Matlab

eam = emotient_api();

```

This creates a default **emotient_api** object, with these properties:


| Property    | Description                              |
|------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| user        | User name (saved in [users](./users))    |
| media       | List of media file from user's account   |
| report      | String (not used)                        |
| status      | Processing status                        |
| videos      | Videos to upload, download or delete     |
| files       | List of downloaded files                 |
| outdir      | Output directory for .files              |
| page        | Items displayed by page on api           |
| api_base    | 'https://api.emotient.com'               |
| api_version | 1                                        |
| apipath     | Path to 'emotient-matlab'                |
| options     | "WEBOPTION" objects used to define users |


The field **option** is a [WEBOPTIONS](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/weboptions.html) isntance, and it is used to generate a user profile. This property has several options. The ones that can be modified by the user are:


| Fields   | Description         |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| Timeout  | Sec. before timeout |
| Username | User name           |
| Password | Password            |
| KeyValue | Authentication key  |


Examples
================

1. Create a "user" profile

```Matlab

obj = emotient_api();
obj.set('user','Username','frossi','KeyValue','some-key')

```

The method **.set** allows to add a user profile. Required arguments are 'Username' and 'KeyValue'. The first argument, 'user', tells **.set** which property is being set. When you set a user, a [user].mat file is automatically saved in the directory "users." If you want to use a user profile which already exists, you can construct the **emotient_api** object as follow:

```Matlab

obj = emotient_api('user','frossi');

```

2. Retrieve your media files

The property **.media** is originally empty, but you can populate it with uploaded moviea names (i.e. obj.media.videos) and file unique id (i.e. obj.media.id). In order to populate this property, you can use the following code:

```Matlab

obj.list();

```

3. Select a set of files to download

After listing all the files in your Emotient directory, you can select to download a subset of them:

```Matlab

% Select output directory
obj.set('outdir','some/output/directory');
% Select a set of videos
use_videos = {'video1.mov','video2.mov', ..., 'videoK.mov'};
obj.set('videos',use_videos);

% Download the videos
obj.grab();

```

If the option property **obj.videos** is empty, the processed files from yor Emotient account will be downloaded.


4. Upload new media

5. Delete media files
