fex-metrica
===========

fex_met 1.0.1 is the first documented version of my preprocessing scripts and statistical tools for the analysis of time series of facial expressions.

The package so far contains only Matlab script for perprocessing the timeseries outputed by FACET/CERT.

After you download the folder, you need to add it to your matlab path, and you can start using the various functions. Additionally, there is an "example" folder, which contains some notes on how to preprocess FACET timeseris, and how to generate facial features, such as Gaussian bumbs or complex Morelet wavelets.

The module in the folder src/preproc/fexfacetutil works on Linux only. Follow instructions in the README file provided there for installation.

I am keeping this project private for the time being, because there is a ton of code I need to add.
